analyze.sh
        Runs 1. ./analyzeStars.sh
             2. python JCDFig3Plot.py
             3. ./analyzeBump.sh true

analyzeStars.sh
        For all mass directories in mass (directory), cd's
        to the inner LOGS directory. There creates Analysis directory,
        and copies and runs python scripts locateBump.py, and HRplot.py.
        Then calls ./grabPlots.py.

analyzeBump.sh
        For each mass in mass (directory) uses output from python scripts
        in LOGS/Analysis to find a model for the star before the bump.
        Then creates bumpTrack directory and sets up MESA to run
        from before the bump, to a little after. With arg1=true this will
        also submit the MESA job to the cluster.
